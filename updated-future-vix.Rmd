Note the distance between the highest blue box and the second highest is some rough measure of how much volatility was added by one - ONE! - day.

Yesterday's movement produced that blue square with the arrow pointing to it by juicing the 20-day rolling volatility. Prior to that, since START DATE, the VIX has mostly been underpredicting subsequent volatility. Indeed, I see only one other observation where actual, subsequent volatility was higher than predicted by the VIX. 

I have no idea what caused this (though the prevailing theory seems to be inflation fears -> interest rate increases) but I do think this chart puts into context what we saw yesteray was an historically unusual and it's normal for the VIX to miss a few of those. Have a look at the chart below.
